# Political Polarization Simulation using Streamlit
In the paper ["Preventing extreme polarization of political attitudes"](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/50/e2102139118) the authors present a model of political polarization in which individuals are influenced by the opinions of others.

This repository contains a Streamlit app that simulates the model presented in the paper. The app allows you to change the parameters of the model and see how the political polarization evolves over time. 

[Try the app on Streamlit](https://bhundt-polarization-simulation.streamlit.app).

See this blogpost for more details: [Political Polarization Simulation using Streamlit](). 

## Local Setup
Start simulation by executing ```streamlit run streamlit_app.py```
